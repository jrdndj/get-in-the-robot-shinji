## Research Plan

### Phase 1 — Literature Review  
A systematic review combining:  
- Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) cockpit and teleoperation stations  
- Space habitat and spacecraft cockpit ergonomics  
- VR affordance design and spatial invitation cues  
- SPACE CHI-style frameworks on space readiness, immersion, and environmental evaluation  

**Output:** Annotated bibliographies, design principles, and research gaps.

---

### Phase 2 — Ecological Validity & Space-Readiness Pilot  
A preliminary VR study testing:  
- Whether VR environments can reliably simulate cockpit approach and entry  
- How immersion, presence, and spatial cues influence “readiness to enter”  
- Which metrics from SPACE CHI (e.g., immersion factors, spatial pressure, comfort, readiness scales) can be adapted for cockpit contexts  

**Output:** Validated metrics for the main study + refined design requirements.

---

### Phase 3 — VR Cockpit Prototype Development  
Creation of multiple cockpit concepts varying in:  
- Visual openness (open, semi-closed, enclosed)  
- Control metaphors (manual controls, hybrid, gestural)  
- Environmental mood (lighting, color, sound cues)  
- Narrative framing (robotic, space exploration, civilian, military)  

Unity will be used to build immersive, interactive prototypes.

**Output:** A VR experimental suite with 3–5 cockpit designs.

---

### Phase 4 — Evaluation  
A mixed-methods study measuring:  
- **Willingness to enter** (quantitative choices + behavioral time-to-enter)  
- **Perceived safety, comfort, trust, readiness** (SPACE CHI-inspired scales)  
- **Affective response** to cockpit variations  
- **Interviews** exploring decision-making and perceptual cues  

**Output:** Insights into what encourages cockpit entry + design guidelines.
